Bacall_Face: An illustration in openFrameworks of the Boognish, a logo for the band Ween.

Bacall_Animation: Skateboarding dog graphic I drew in openFrameworks animated to rotate, and to travel in an endless path using the ofNoise function. Press the mouse to delete the trail left by the dog, press z to turn the trail off, press x to turn the trail back on. Press c to stop the dogâ€™s rotation, and press v to turn rotation back on. Use the s key to take a screenshot.

Bacall_Add-ons: Add-ons required: ofxPostGlitch, ofxGui. Use the Gui slider to effect the rotation speed of the dog. Unaffected images are generated on the left. Use buttons 1 through 0 to add various glitch effects to the right side of the screen, hitting more than one button at a time adds multiple effects. The q through u keys to change the color on the right side of the screen. Use the L key to switch between the 3d and 2d images. Use the h key to toggle the help menu. Use the s key to take a screenshot.
