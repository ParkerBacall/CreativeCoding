Bacall_Animation: 
Skateboarding dog graphic I drew in openFrameworks animated to rotate, and to travel in an endless path using the ofNoise function. Press the mouse to delete the trail left by the dog, press ‘z’ to turn the trail off, press ‘x’ to turn the trail back on. Press ‘c’ to stop the dog’s rotation, and press ‘v’ to turn rotation back on. Use the ’s’ key to take a screenshot.

Bacall_Add-ons: Add-ons required: ofxPostGlitch, ofxGui. 

Use the Gui slider to effect the rotation speed of the dog. Unaffected images are generated on the left. Use keys ‘1’ through ‘0’ to add various glitch effects to the screen, hitting more than one button at a time adds multiple effects. The ‘q’ through ‘u’ keys change the color on the screen. Use the ‘l’ key to switch between the 3d and 2d images. Use the ‘h’ key to toggle the help menu. Use the ’s’ key to take a screenshot.

Bacall_Project1: Add-ons required: ofxPostGlitch, ofxGui, ofxAppUtils, ofxCellularAutomata. 

This program features three different scenes generated using ofxCellularAutomata.

To move through the scenes use the left and right arrow keys. The down key will stop the scene from running, and the up key will reload the scene at the same point it was at.  The 'a' key will change the rule generating the cellular structure. The 'd' key will toggle display of the current frame rate, rule and scene. The 'p' key will pause the current scene and hitting 'p' again will resume the scene, but not reload the scene. In any of the three scenes keys ‘1’ through ‘0’ on the keyboard will add glitch effects to the scene and keys ‘q’ through ‘u’ will effect the color of the scene. The 's' key can be used to take a screenshot in any scene to save your generative glitch art!
